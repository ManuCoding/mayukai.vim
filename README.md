# mayukai.vim
Vim port of the [Mayukai](https://github.com/GulajavaMinistudio/Mayukai-Theme) color scheme by [GulajavaMinistudio](https://github.com/GulajavaMinistudio).
Currently very bare bones, I just got something that works.
It also supports 16-color environments.

# Usage
Either install this repo using your favorite Vim plugin manager or copy the file `colors/mayukai.vim` inside your `.vim/colors` directory.
